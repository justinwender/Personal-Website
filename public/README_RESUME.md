# Resume PDF Instructions

## How to Add Your Resume PDF

1. Save your resume as a PDF file named `resume.pdf`
2. Place it in this `/public` directory
3. The download button on the Resume page will automatically link to it

**File path:** `/public/resume.pdf`

The resume download functionality is already configured in `app/resume/page.tsx` - just add your PDF file here and it will work automatically.
