- Add filtering/category system (ready for future projects)
- Include clear CTAs: "More projects coming soon" or similar
- Once repos are ready (Optimum Shiny app, etc.), can easily slot them in
- **Rationale:** Better to launch with solid foundation and add projects than delay launch

**Blog/Writing Section - "Ghost Page" Approach:**
- Build complete blog infrastructure (MDX setup, post templates, listing page)
- Feature Gamma Options article as first major piece
- Include The Legal Intelligencer publications (already published)
- Design allows easy addition of new posts once Medium drafts are polished
- Set up proper metadata, syntax highlighting, reading time (all ready to go)
- **Rationale:** Launch with existing publications, add new content as it's ready

**Gamma Options Article:**
- Ready to publish ✓
- Will be featured prominently in Writing section
- Note: "Originally written for Gamma Options launch (pre-shutdown)"
- Great showcase of DeFi knowledge and technical writing

**Professional Photo:**
- High-quality headshot provided ✓
- Professional setting, good lighting, neutral background
- Perfect for About page and possible homepage

### 🎯 Revised MVP Scope

**What We'll Build Now (Phase 1 Launch):**
1. ✅ **Homepage:** Hero with particles, quick stats, CTAs, social links
2. ✅ **About Page:** Full bio, experience timeline, skills showcase
3. ✅ **Projects Page:** Complete UI with Gamma Options article featured, structure ready for future additions
4. ✅ **Writing/Blog Page:** Gamma Options + Legal Intelligencer articles, infrastructure for new posts
5. ✅ **Resume Page:** Interactive web version + downloadable PDF
6. ✅ **Contact Page:** Form, contact info, social links

**What We'll Add Post-Launch (Phase 2):**
- Optimum Shiny app project (when repo is presentable)
- Other project showcases (Fireblocks, TRGC, NEU research)
- New Medium blog posts (as drafts are published)
- Additional features (dark mode, filtering, search, etc.)

### ⏱️ Timeline & Approach

**Target:** Launch within next month
**Philosophy:** Quality over speed
**Strategy:** Launch solid foundation, iterate and add content as ready
**Tech Learning:** Code will be well-commented for easy understanding (Java/Python/R background will help)

### 🔧 Technical Notes

**Domain Setup:**
- Domain: justinwender.com (Cloudflare)
- Will need to configure DNS to point to Vercel
- Cloudflare DNS management (instructions to follow)

**Content Management:**
- Easy to add new projects: just add new MDX file or JSON entry
- Easy to add new blog posts: add MDX file in `/content/blog`
- Well-structured for non-React developers to understand

**Particle Effects:**
- Start with react-tsparticles (easier, proven)
- Test 2-3 different configurations
- Can upgrade to Three.js later if desired
- Will optimize for performance
