#### Particle Effects
- **Hero Section:** Interactive particle network/constellation
  - Particles respond to cursor movement (magnetic or repelling effect)
  - Subtle animation when idle
  - Connected nodes/lines creating network effect
  - Colors: match green/blue-purple accent scheme
- **Implementation Options:**
  - Three.js (3D, more complex, impressive)

3. **Telegram:** What's your Telegram username or link?

4. **Domain Name Preference:**
   - Do you already own a domain?
   - Preference: `justinwender.com`, `jtwender.com`, `justintwender.com`, or other?

5. **Project Repository Access:**
   - Is your Optimum Shiny app code in a public GitHub repo?
   - Can other projects (Fireblocks work, TRGC research) be shared publicly, or should they be described without code?

6. **Medium Content:**
   - How many Medium posts do you have?
   - Should all be migrated or just featured ones?
   - Preference: Link to Medium vs. full content on site?

7. **Gamma Options Article:**
   - Is this article ready to publish on your site?
   - Or should it be listed as "in progress"?

8. **Professional Photo:**
   - Do you have a professional headshot ready to use?
   - If not, will you take one or use a placeholder initially?

9. **Particle Effect Preference:**
   - Simple 2D particles (react-tsparticles) or more complex 3D (Three.js)?
   - Preference for particle style: connected network nodes, floating particles, constellation, or other?

10. **Timeline:**
    - When do you need this live?
    - Any upcoming interviews or events where you'd want to share the link?

11. **Development Involvement:**
    - Are you comfortable with Next.js/React, or should I keep it simple?
    - Would you like to be able to easily add blog posts yourself?

12. **Content Priority:**
